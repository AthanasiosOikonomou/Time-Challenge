## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications.
- **Vite**: A fast development build tool and server, which is likely used to bundle the application.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The project uses modern JavaScript syntax and features.
- **CSS**: The project uses plain CSS for styling, with global styles defined in `index.css`.
- **JSX**: JavaScript XML is used for templating in React components.

## Project Structure

- `src/`
  - `App.jsx`: The main component that serves as the entry point for the application.
  - `assets/`: This directory contains static assets like images or fonts.
  - `components/`: This directory contains reusable React components that make up the UI.
  - `index.css`: Global CSS styles for the application.
  - `main.jsx`: The entry file that renders the React application into the DOM.
